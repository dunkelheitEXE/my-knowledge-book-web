## What is happening with Nvidia?

Lately, many distros are stopping their support to old nvidia drivers (as my situation is), such as ``nvidia-470-drivers`` for GPU's like GTX 600's line or GTX 400's Line.

This represents a problem to people like me, that is using old nvidia GPU's, so here, you can find distributions that works well with those kind of GPUs

- Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish
- POP_OS! 22.04 LTS (Ubuntu Jammy based distro)
- Debian 12 Bookworm
- Linux Mint
- Arch linux based distros
